h3. A replacement for TextMate's Find In Project

Aim: Provide the speed of git-grep (or normal grep) to TextMate projects.

h2. Why?

*In the beginning* you had to stare at the beachball while TextMate searched synchronously through your project. Crashes occurred whenever it encountered a large file or was bored. Then came the grep bundles. They were good, but unfortunately they suffered the limitations of the TextMate bundle system. 

_nice_find_ is a TextMate plugin that is written in Objective C and interacts directly with TextMate. It uses grep (or git-grep where available). As a result it is faster, more intuitive, and has a native look and feel that is the envy of all the bundles.

h2. How?

Download the bundle "here":http://cloud.github.com/downloads/briancollins/nice_find/NiceFind.tmplugin.zip extract and double click on it to install it in TextMate. Or build it in xcode and it will be installed by the build script.

In a TextMate project, hit command-shift-f and use the find dialog normally.

h2. Limitations

No replace support yet, but soon.
No support for multi-line regexes yet, but also soon.
